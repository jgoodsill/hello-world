Basic git hub tutorial

Hi Humans

I am getting ready to take a code academy class starting March 13th to review HTML, CSS and Java Script.  Hope to make a web game at the end of this 10 week course.  I will need about 10 hours per week.  My plan is to come in early every day and get in at least one hour before my day begins and give up 1/2 day each weekend.  

Adding a second update to this file.
